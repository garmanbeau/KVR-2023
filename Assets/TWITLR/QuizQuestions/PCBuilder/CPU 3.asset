  question: What does the CPU's clock speed indicate?
  wrongAnswers:
  - How much power the CPU uses
  - The physical size of the CPU
  - ' The weight of the CPU'
  correctAnswer: How many instructions per second it can execute
  hint: Think of it in terms of speed; more GHz means more cycles in a second.
