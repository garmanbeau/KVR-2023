  question: What happens after the BIOS completes its startup checks?
  wrongAnswers:
  - The computer shuts down
  - The screen saver starts
  - The BIOS plays a welcome sound
  correctAnswer: The BIOS hands over control to the operating system
  hint: After the BIOS does its initial job, it needs to let another crucial part
    of the computer take over to fully start up the system.
